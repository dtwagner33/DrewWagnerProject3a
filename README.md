This is an extension of Project 3 in which we created a command line stock visualizer application.
This update takes the functionality of the stock visualizer and turns it into a web application using flask and docker.
My group is Scrum Team 8, made up of myself (Drew Wagner), Caroline Kirby, Cassie Beisheim, and Brendan Graham. We met a couple of times to go over requirements and help fix any issues people had to get on the same page.
